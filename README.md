# IoT ESP32 Control Demonstration with Adafruit Dashboard
# Overview:
This project demonstrates the control of an ESP32 microcontroller using Adafruit Dashboard via MQTT protocol in the Wokwi simulator. The project comprises five mini projects showcasing various functionalities controlled through the Adafruit Dashboard.

# Mini Projects:
1. # LED Control with Switch:
Demonstrates controlling an LED connected to the ESP32 via a switch on the Adafruit Dashboard.

2. # Text Input and Display on LCD:
Allows users to input text on the Adafruit Dashboard and displays it on an LCD screen connected to the ESP32 in the Wokwi simulator.

3. # File Upload and Display:
Enables users to upload a file (picture or JSON) through the Adafruit Dashboard and displays it on the Wokwi simulator.
Usage:


# Dependencies:
Adafruit IO account for creating dashboards and sending data to ESP32.
Wokwi simulator for simulating ESP32 and its peripherals.
ESP32 development environment for compiling and uploading code to the microcontroller.

# Acknowledgments:
Special thanks to Adafruit, Wokwi, and the ESP32 community for their invaluable resources and support in developing this project.
