# IoT ESP32 Control Demonstration with Adafruit Dashboard
# Overview:
This project demonstrates the control of an ESP32 microcontroller using Adafruit Dashboard via MQTT protocol in the Wokwi simulator. The project comprises five mini projects showcasing various functionalities controlled through the Adafruit Dashboard.

# Mini Projects:
## 1. LED Control with Switch:
Demonstrates controlling an LED connected to the ESP32 via a switch on the Adafruit Dashboard.

## 2. Text Input and Display on LCD / Text output display on Adafruit text box:
Allows users to input text on the Adafruit Dashboard and displays it on an LCD screen connected to the ESP32 in the Wokwi simulator, allow user to output text and display it on Adafruit text box (in Dashboard)

## 3. File Upload and Display:
Allows users to insert a url file containing (image or JSON) through the wokwi code and displays it in the simulator and displays it in adafruit.

## 4. Transmission of information from the ESP32 under artificial control
transfer information to adafruit by our artificial control, we will create a button that, when clicked, will transfer information from a temperature gauge to adafruit , transfer information on demand and not in a stream

# Dependencies:
Adafruit IO account for creating dashboards and sending data to ESP32.
Wokwi simulator for simulating ESP32 and its peripherals.
ESP32 development environment for compiling and uploading code to the microcontroller.

# Acknowledgments:
Special thanks to Adafruit, Wokwi, and the ESP32 community for their invaluable resources and support in developing this project.
